# Hydraid

## Frontend

We used React Native for the frontend. In the application, we utilized Async Storage in order to save user information even when they exit and reenter the application. We also were able to integrate the app with our load sensor using Bluetooth to allow for easy communication. This process can be found in the Bluetooth screen. A constantly running loop in the background gathers load sensor readings and adjusts the user's water intake accordingly.
